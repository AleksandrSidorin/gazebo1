Modeling the robot Manipulator

Description:
In this project I model the Manipulator, which I invented by myself. Modeling robot is a useful project for me because I am interested in how different manipulators work and how to control them.

Aims:
- Figuring out how to work in Ros, Rviz, Gazebo
- Figuring out how to write Urdf file
- Learning how to model robots

In order to launch my robot Manipulator:
- Open the terminal
- Print "cd"your workspace"/src/
- Print "git clone https://github.com/AleksandrSidorin/Gazedo1"
- Print "catkin_make"
- Print "roslaunch gazebo1 gazebo.launch"
